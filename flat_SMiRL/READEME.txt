Some scripts for the SMiRL algorithm implementation with Q learning.
Takes only *flat* inputs.

I am considering alternatives (e.g. conv nets) because many VAE implementations
use bernoulli output, which requires the range [0,1]. I cannot make
the same assumption when I am giving the agent state data.

Alternatively I can implement a VAE with Gaussian output. However this is running into training
stability issues that I do not have a good solution for currently.
